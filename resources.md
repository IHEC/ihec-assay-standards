# Consensus resources for International Human Epigenome Consortium

This page is meant to be a mirror of GRCh38 resources published by EBI, and also maintained at [epigenomes.ca](http://www.epigenomes.ca/data/CEMT/resources/index.html)

Additionally, other resources on which consensus within IHEC is achieved will be located here for reference to ensure that all data is processed using the same resources.

## GRCh38 reference build

The GRCh38 reference build chosen by IHEC is available at:

# Gene annotations

Pleasse note that the IHEC has moved from v22 to v29 annotations. For original v22 references see: http://www.epigenomes.ca/data/CEMT/resources/index.v22.html

The v29 comprehensive gene annotations are available at:

ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_29/gencode.v29.annotation.gtf.gz
